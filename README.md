> An Em(ber) command line utility to help developer(s) build an ambitious web application. It is highly inspired by other open source projects, [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli), [ember-tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools), [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit), [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/).


## Getting Started

    npm install -g ember-rocks

After it is done, you should have a global command `em` available. Try `em --help`, you should see a list of helper information. Try `em generate --help` to see a specific command helper information.


## Features

- well align with Ember-Cli project
- gulp ( a build tool of choice ) build insanely fast via node stream api
- lighting fast development rebuild system
- live reload on all resources
- super powerful generator system
- hackable express server as back end
- build a production ready application and ready to be deployed
- tablet and touch device support out of box


## A sample ember app in the Ember Rocks

**Ember Rocks** comes with a sample application, and user could even have their own set of templates. See [Ember Rocks Template Basic](https://github.com/mattma/Ember-Rocks-Template-Basic) for details.

An express server will handle all requests. A fake user api route will read the RESTful json api on the disk, return the data over the wire when Ember app request the data via latest **Ember Data** library.  

The fully stylish application works on touch and tablet devices out of box. Try to resize your browser into a smaller screen resolution, you should see an animated effect from the left edge which is the most popular choice of mobile application navigation menu. You could tweak the styles and markup to fit your use cases. 


## Ember-cli is being developed and maintained by Ember core team member. Why am I building another em(ber)-cli?

**Ember** is an opinionated framework, and **Ember-cli** has chosen [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) as its build tool and [Qunit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) as its testing tool. **Ember-cli** project is trying to be an universal toolset to fit most of use cases for majority of **Ember** developers. **Ember-Cli** is awesome. 

After built a large Backbone application (>15000 LOC), I developed a set of developer toolings which fit my workflow well. **Ember Rocks** approach is my opinionated toolset on building a large scaled Node.js modern web application with Ember.js framework on the client side.

**Ember Rocks** can be globally installed on your local machine ( tested on Linux based operating system ) via `npm install -g ember-rocks`. After you have done that, magic happens :). You would have an `em` command available. Try `em --help`, `em generate --help` for a comprehensive guide. 

**Ember Rocks** is chosen [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) as a build tool. In fact, it is powered by [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) under the hook. **Ember-cli** choose [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli). The main difference between two awesome build tools is, *broccoli* use "directory in, directory out" pattern, and *gulp* use "file in, file out" pattern. *gulp* takes advantage of *Node Stream* to pipe files to destination folder. This is the one I perfer for now until [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) is out of beta. Sorry, [Jo Liss](https://twitter.com/jo_liss), you are awesome.

In addition, technology stack besides Ember.js, I have picked [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as css pre-compiler, [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer) as css post-compiler, [express](http://expressjs.com/) as node web application server, and [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) as javascript testing framework. 

Just like [lodash](lodash.com) is a project which solve the same problem that [underscore](http://underscorejs.com/) does, [Ember Rocks](https://github.com/mattma/ember-rocks) is trying to solve similar problem that [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) does. I will try to sync the features from [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) to [Ember Rocks](https://github.com/mattma/ember-rocks). 

What is on my road map? Ember Add-on, component with d3 support, and more. PRs is highly welcomed and appreciated. 


## Quick Start

    em new my-app          // generate a brand new ember app in *my-app* folder
    cd my-app              // switch to application folder
    em serve               // start a server, open the new app in browser, livereload all resources


## Usage
    
    em [command] [options]

    Commands:

        new [options]      // Creates a new ember application at [dirName]
           
        g|generate         // Generate a new file with ES6 support in the ember app
               
        s|serve            // Builds and serves your app, rebuilding on file changes.
           
        b|build            // Release your app and places it into the output path '~/build'
       
    Options:

        -h, --help     output usage information
        -V, --version  output the version number

    Command-Specific Help:

        em [command] --help


## TODO

- Add ember testing support with Mocha adapter
   ( It should work with the existing ember rocks architecture )


## Guide

Since the project is highly inspired by [Ember-Cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/), ( both projects even share the same commands but completely different implementation under the hook, i.e. `em(ber) new`, `em(ber) generate`, `em(ber) g`, `em(ber) serve`, `em(ber) build`, etc ), **Ember Rocks** uses the same modules -- [ember resolver](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-jj-abrams-resolver), and [ember load initializers](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-load-initializers). Ember Modules system ( *client/app/* ) and the resolver guide will apply to **Ember Rocks** modules and the resolver as well.
